Whether

I have developed a web page that fetches real-time weather data from a weather API, based either on the user's location or a location inputted by the user. The page displays current weather conditions, temperature, and other pertinent information in a clear and user-friendly format. This project demonstrates my proficiency in integrating APIs and creating dynamic content for a practical web application.
